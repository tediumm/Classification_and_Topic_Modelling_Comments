# Classification_and_Topic_Modelling_Comments
In short: making and comparing two classificators (Random Forest and BERT) and aftermath topic modelling with NMF

## Initial task:
Here's a file containing complaints and questions addressed to state and municipal authorities that users have left on social networks. It is necessary to train a model that will assign a class to messages (complaint/question). To do this:
* make initial processing and conduct exploratory analysis of the data and describe the conclusions obtained on its basis;      
* train the classifier/classifiers, justify the choice of model/models;      
* evaluate the quality of classification;     
* describe the problems you encountered while completing the task, make recommendations for improvement models/data enrichment.
